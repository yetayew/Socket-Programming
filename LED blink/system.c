 Notes:
     PLL = Phase Locked Loop - Is an electronic circuit consisting of
	                           Current controlled oscillator(CCO), phase detector
 							   and frequency multiplier.
		   The task of the PLL is to generate the required clock for the CPU from
		   the crystal oscillator base frequency.
		   
	 PLL feed code = The byte sequence (0xAA-0x55) is required to change the PLL config.
	                 to protect it from changing inadvertently by spurious system activity
					 or external processes.
